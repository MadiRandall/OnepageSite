<h3> Myth 1: Lake Burley Griffin fills up other ponds and lakes in New Zealand.</h3>
<h2>False </h2>
<p> It is likely that water from Lake Burley Griffin has landed not only in ponds and lakes in New Zealand
     but also in the ocean and even in America due to evaporation.
     This theory initially started out with people believing that every time Lake Burley Griffin rises,
    a lake rises in New Zealand, but due to water being evaporated constantly when it rains,
     that water that was evaporated falls back down to earth, but there is no water stream that leads directly to ponds in New Zealand.
      Lake Burley Griffin only runs to the Molonglo River. </p>

    <h3> Myth 2:The missing bodies of Cadets from Duntroon are still in Lake Burley Griffin.</h3>
    <h2> False </h2>
    <p>
        Five cadets were in a boat on Lake Burley Griffin and the boat capsized due to ‘rough waters'.
         Many people find it difficult to believe that these cadets drowned in rough waters when Lake Burley Griffin has very few waves as it
         and resides in the centre of Canberra. 
         This brought the initial theory of there being a'monster' within Lake Burley Griffin as that was the only reason these cadets could have drowned 
         in some not-so-rough waters. The police report has all five cadet bodies accounted for.

    <h3> Myth 3: A large cat was found hunting in the early settlement in the 1830s. </h3>
    <h2> False</h2>
    <p>This theory, which dates back centuries, is hard to prove real or fake today. 
        Scientists believe this large cat could have been a mutation from livestock's, 
        as apparently the European livestock were ‘breeding like rabbits’ so this is a very promising lead,
         but another point of view is that it could have been an indigenous person who was hunting as the Europeans were not accustomed to the indigenous people at the time, 
        so it is likely from a distance it could have been an indigenous person.</p>

    <h3> Myth 4: Is Bunyip real? </h3>
    <h2> False </h2>
    <p>This mythical creature known as a bunyip from aboriginal dreamtime stories scientists believe is a mutation on an animal, 
        as this animal lived near swamps and would make roaring noises and booming noises and apparently feed on women and children. 
        This animal is said to have a body that resembles an ox, hippopotamus, or manatee. Due to the mix of multiple different animal features and living in these conditions, 
        scientists believe these are mutations, as not many animals live in the swamp,
         so it is highly likely it is a genetic mutation.</p>

    <h3> Myth 5: Capabilities built by the government will leak.</h3>
    <h2> False </h2>
    <p>To some people, the fear of top-secret government documents is a concern as hacking, scammers, and impersonation of important figures
         are becoming more common. It is a genuine fear for many, as, depending on the documentation,
          it can be used as a weapon in some countries. But due to the growing rate of technology, 
          the government and other communities have implemented many forms of protection and strict protocols, 
        so their cyber security is tight and difficult to hack into.</p>
