# assesment 3

# notes
when creating this website i found difficulties in trying to confine the text into a smaller paragraph but was unable to do so, i made the text so no matter how small the preview is the text is still visable. 
I also added a scroll animation which works intermittently i have looked back on the code and compaired it to other turoials on the internet but could not find why it was working intermittently. 
i enured to have an even number of images to text and a pop of colour for the user as these will keep them engaged with the webpage. 
Image for Myth 3 was created on photoshop as there was no images i could find to best suite the myth.
